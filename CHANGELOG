1.3.1 (2012-5-16)
---
Fixed delay before starting Dropbox app for authentication (in ICS).

1.3 (2012-3-26)
---
Add support for the /delta API.
Add support for the "copy ref" API.

1.2.3 (2012-1-11)
---
Fixed rare crash during authentication through a web browser (when Dropbox app is not installed)
Added file metadata to DropboxFileInfo when downloading files (and getting
thumbnails).
 - Same structure as the data returned by the metadata call.
 - Saves having to do 2 RPCs to get both the file and its revision.
DropboxFileInfo.getFileSize() is guaranteed to be the file size on file
downloads (and thumbnail requests).
 - Previously, on chunked downloads (if accepting gzip encodings), would be zero.
